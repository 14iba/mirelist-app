# mirelist

*a small, mossy to-do list that lives quietly on your laptop.*

mirelist is a lightweight, offline-capable to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. designed for people who prefer their tools **private, tactile, and atmospheric**.  
no accounts. no cloud. no noise. just tasks, ink, and shadows.

inspired by dark forests, damp stone, old notebooks, and quiet focus. stay witchy my beloveds !

## 🌘 aesthetic direction because we do be vibing

mirelist leans into:
- mossy greens  
- muted navy blues  
- subtle imperfections

## philosophy aka my thoughts whilst building it

- **offline-first by design**
- **open source and transparent + your data remains YOURS**
- **tools should feel calm, not demanding**
- **your unfinished tasks should not seem scary, rather something to look forward to**

## data storage

- uses local filesystem
- no external APIs

you can delete the app and your data disappears with it.

---

## platform

## 🚫 what mirelist is not

- ❌ no cloud sync
- ❌ no accounts
- ❌ no collaboration
- ❌ no notifications
- ❌ no social features

this is intentional. because the creator (aka -> me) happens to be a privacy maniac :)
